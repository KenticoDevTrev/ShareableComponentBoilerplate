Schedule no. 4 of the License Agreement – List of the variants of the Software licenses
1.  The LICENSOR offers the following variants of the Software licenses:
A.  The “1 Website License” variant of the Software allows the LICENSEE to use the Software to run one (1) web presentation on one (1) server.
B.  The “1 Website License for Unlimited Servers (perpetual)” variant of the Software allows the LICENSEE to use the Software to run one (1) website presentation on unlimited servers perpetually.
C.  The “1 Website License for Unlimited Servers (scheduled)” variant of the Software allows the LICENSEE to use the Software to run one (1) website presentation on one (1) server, with a right to extend the number of servers to unlimited servers for 30 consecutive days, two times per year.
D.  The “1 Server License for 10 Sites” variant of the Software allows the LICENSEE to use the Software to run ten (10) web presentations on one (1) server.
E.  The “Unlimited Server License for 10 Sites” (perpetual)” variant of the Software allows the LICENSEE to use the Software to run ten (10) website presentation on unlimited servers perpetually.
F.  The “Unlimited Server License for 10 Sites (scheduled)” variant of the Software allows the LICENSEE to use the Software to run ten (10) website presentation on one (1) server, with a right to extend the number of servers to unlimited servers for 30 consecutive days, two times per year.
G.  The “1 Server License for Unlimited Sites” variant of the Software allows the LICENSEE to use the Software to run an unlimited number of web presentations on one (1) server.
H.  The “Corporate License” variant of the Software allows the LICENSEE to use the Software to run an unlimited number of web presentations on unlimited servers.
2.  For the purposes of the Agreement, a web presentation is a web presentation with a defined purpose run on one domain of one level (without sub-domains) and listed within the Software in a list of websites as one item. In the event that there are more alternative domain names (aliases) for a domain address directed to the same web presentation, the LICENSEE can request that the LICENSOR extends the authorization to these other domain names.
3.  For the purposes of the Agreement, one server means one physical server (one piece of hardware) or in the event that a copy of the Software is run in an environment known as the “cloud”, one virtual server.
4.  In case that the LICENSEE ceases to use the Software for the purposes of running of any of the listed web presentations, there shall exist no right of the LICENSEE to use the Software to run a different web presentation instead of the terminated one. Thereby the total number of web presentations that are allowed to be run by the Software (according to the variant selected and purchased by the LICENSEE) shall be decreased permanently by number of once run and then terminated web presentations. An actual web presentation is considered terminated (and a new one is considered to be set up and run) also in case when the LICENSEE changes the defined purpose of the actual presentation in a material way, i.e. by more than 40 % during a period of 12 months. In case of doubts the LICENSEE is obliged to approach the LICENSOR to discuss the idea of partial or total change of the web presentation’s defined purpose. Opinion of the LICENSOR regarding the scope of the intended change shall be decisive and controlling. 
5.  In each instance when a variant of the Software called “Additional Servers in a Web Farm“ is provided, the LICENSEE is entitled to use the Software on an additional one (1) server providing that the LICENSOR makes accessible via this server a web presentation identical to the one made accessible via the original server. 
6.  For the purposes of development or testing of a web presentation or for the purposes of a staging server (i.e. up to the moment when a web presentation containing the Software is communicated to the public) the LICENSEE may install the Software on more than one computer. The limitations set out in Section 3.4 of the Agreement are not applicable in this case.

The provisions of this Agreement relating to the Trial version of the Software cease to have effect at the end of the period specified in Section 2.b above or, if the license fee has been paid according to Section 5.1 of the Agreement, once the license key necessary in order to use the Software has been entered.
 
Schedule no. 6 of the License Agreement – Rights and obligations of the Parties relating to the protection and processing of personal data
1.  PRIVACY POLICY
1.1 The LICENSOR may process personal data of the LICENSEE (in case he is a natural person) and personal data of persons acting on behalf of the LICENSEE in connection with the performance of the Agreement. The LICENSOR will process such personal data in particular for the purpose of performing the Agreement. Detailed information on how the LICENSOR will process such personal data is provided in the LICENSOR’s Privacy Policy (available online, under the following link: https://www.kentico.com/kentico-com-privacy-policy).
1.2 The LICENSEE is obliged to ensure that the personal data of persons acting on behalf of the LICENSEE are handed over to the LICENSOR in accordance with the GDPR, or any successor legislation to the GDPR (“Data Protection Legislation”) and that the respective persons are informed that their personal data are handed over to the LICENSOR and for what purpose.
2.  PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING – SUPPORT SERVICES
2.1 If during the provision of the support services pursuant to the Agreement the LICENSOR gains access to personal data of the LICENSEE or other persons controlled or processed by the LICENSEE, in particular personal data of customers of the LICENSEE (“Personal Data”), and works with the Personal Data in such a way that it becomes its processor within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Data Protection Legislation, the LICENSOR undertakes to comply with this Clause 2 hereof while processing the Personal Data.
2.2 The LICENSOR shall process the Personal Data solely for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations to provide the support services under the Agreement and on the documented instructions of the LICENSEE (including with regard to possible transfer of the Personal Data to a third country or an international organization), issued in accordance with the Agreement unless the LICENSOR is required by the laws of any member state of the European Union or by the laws of the European Union applicable to the LICENSOR (“Applicable Laws”) to process the Personal Data. Where the LICENSOR is relying on Applicable Laws as the basis for processing of the Personal Data, the LICENSOR shall promptly notify the LICENSEE of this before performing the processing required by the Applicable Laws, unless those Applicable Laws prohibit the LICENSOR from so notifying the LICENSEE. The instructions to the LICENSOR regarding the processing of the Personal Data will usually arise directly from the Agreement and requested support services. The LICENSOR shall notify the LICENSEE in case, in the LICENSOR’s opinion, any of the LICENSEE’s instruction violates the Data Protection Legislation or other data protection legislation of a relevant member state of the European Union.
2.3 The LICENSEE shall fulfil all obligations arising out of its role as a data controller according to the Data Protection Legislation, or, in the case where the LICENSEE is a data processor, fulfil all obligations arising out of its role as a data processor and ensure that the data controller fulfils all obligations arising out of its role as a data controller. The LICENSEE will ensure that it has all necessary appropriate consents and notices in place to enable lawful transfer of the Personal Data to the LICENSOR for the duration and purposes of the Agreement so that the LICENSOR may lawfully use, process and transfer the Personal Data in accordance with the Agreement on the LICENSEE’s behalf.
2.4 The LICENSOR undertakes not to disclose the Personal Data to persons other than to the LICENSOR’s employees, contractual advisors and sub-processors (in accordance with Clauses 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 hereof) who are subject to contractual or statutory obligation of confidentiality.
2.5 Further, the LICENSOR shall:
2.5.1   taking into account the nature of the processing, upon the LICENSEE’s written request, assist the LICENSEE by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the LICENSEE’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR;
2.5.2   upon the LICENSEE’s written request, assist the LICENSEE in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR (e.g., security, breach notifications, impact assessments) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the LICENSOR;
2.5.3   notify the LICENSEE without undue delay on becoming aware of a personal data breach;
2.5.4   maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate its compliance with this Clause 2 hereof;
2.5.5   upon the LICENSEE’s written request provide the LICENSEE with all information necessary to prove the compliance with this Clause 2 hereof;
2.5.6   upon the LICENSEE’s written request, enable audits, including inspections, carried out by an independent auditor authorized by the LICENSEE and assist with these audits. The LICENSEE needs to notify to the LICENSOR the intention to carry out the audit and identity of the authorized auditor in advance and enable the LICENSOR to raise objections against the identity of the authorized auditor. The audit will be carried out in time adequate to the extent of the audit and capacities of the LICENSOR, agreed upon by the Parties. Prior to the audit, the authorized auditor shall enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the LICENSOR or prove that it is subject to a statutory obligation of confidentiality.
2.6 Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing of the Personal Data as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, each Party shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security of the Personal Data appropriate to the risk.
2.7 In case where the LICENSOR provides the LICENSEE with any assistance or cooperation according to this Clause 2 hereof (especially pursuant to Clauses 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.5 or 2.5.6 hereof), the LICENSEE shall pay to the LICENSOR corresponding charges according to the Kentico price list valid at the time of the respective activity, upon LICENSOR’s request.
2.8 The LICENSOR shall process the Personal Data for only as long as it is truly necessary to provide the support services pursuant to the Agreement, but not longer than until the Agreement expires or is terminated. After the expiry or termination of the Agreement, any Personal Data at LICENSOR’s disposal will be stored and made available to the LICENSEE upon written request for 30 days following the expiry or termination of the Agreement. After the 30-day period, the Personal Data will be irrecoverably deleted, unless according to the Applicable laws, the LICENSOR is obliged to store the respective Personal Data.
2.9 The LICENSEE consents to the LICENSOR appointing third-party processors of Personal Data including but not limited to Microsoft Corporation (please see Clause 2.10 bellow), eventually including its subcontractors, and affiliated companies of the LICENSOR. The LICENSOR confirms that it has entered or will enter into written agreements with the third-party processors imposing on the third-party processors the appropriate data protection obligations under the Data Protection Legislation. In the case where the LICENSOR appoints any third-party processor, it shall proceed in accordance with sec. 28 (2 and 4) of the GDPR. In the case where any third-party processor is seated outside the European Union, the LICENSOR shall ensure any Personal Data will be transferred to such processor in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation, especially to provide appropriate safeguards in relation to the transfer. As between the LICENSEE and the LICENSOR, the LICENSOR shall remain fully liable for all acts or omissions of any third-party processor appointed by it pursuant to this Clause 2 hereof.
2.10    The LICENSOR uses the Microsoft Corporation as a cloud computing services provider (“Microsoft Azure Services”). During the provision of the support services pursuant to the Agreement the Personal Data may be saved in the cloud service. In that case, Microsoft Corporation and eventually its subcontractors (a list of the subcontractors is available at the following link https://aka.ms/Online_Serv_Subcontractor_List) will participate on the Personal Data processing. The Parties agreed that, as regards the processing of Personal Data by Microsoft Corporation, the LICENSOR is bound to the LICENSEE by the obligations specified in this Schedule to the extent the Microsoft Corporation is bound to the LICENSOR by the licensing terms of Microsoft Corporation, namely, but not limited to, the Online Services Terms (OST) available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/product-licensing/products.aspx.
2.11    The LICENSOR reserves the right to change unilaterally any third-party processor of the Personal Data or engage a new one. The LICENSOR shall inform the LICENSEE of any such changes in advance, thereby giving the LICENSEE the opportunity to object to such changes. In case of a change of the cloud computing services provider, the LICENSOR will ensure the level of data protection under the new cloud computing services will be commensurate with Microsoft Azure Services.
